### YouTube Update: The YouTube Dislike Button Remains, with Number of Dislikes Hidden from Public

* On November 10, 2021, YouTube announced that video **dislike counts** will be hidden from the public.  The stated benefit is protecting creators (especially smaller ones) from dislike attacks and harassment.
* The number of dislikes is only available in Studio to content creators.
* Announcement and Comments: https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/134791097/update-to-youtube-dislike-counts?hl=en

### Let's Analyze Sentiment for the Dislike Button Update!  üßê
The public provided comments on YouTube's dislike change.  Let's score comment sentiment.  This is done on a scale of -1.0  to +1.0 (most negative to most positive sentiment).  We use the DistilBERT **[1]** language model from the easy-to-use [flair NLP library](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) to predict sentiment.

Here is the methodology.  A comment is made of sentences and sentiment is scored for each sentence.  The flair score is the average sentiment for all sentences (or emoticons) in the comment.  For example, if a comment has seven sentences, then the score is the average of the seven sentiments.  Below is an illustration.

### Results
There were 613 total comments scored.  The bulk of the comments are negative sentiment.  The median sentiment is -0.739.  So half the comments score below -0.739 and half score above.  

A comment with an average sentiment of 0 is in theory neutral.  Remember, sentiment based on sentence-level predictions by the DistilBERT model.

The comments were posted between November 10 and November 22 in 2021.  That is 13 days.  Did sentiment move over time?

Below is the sentiment plot for November 10-22.  The flat regression line reveals that daily sentiment moved little between November 10 and November 22.  Note

### Final Thoughts
The sentiment classification (flair score) of a sentence may be spot on.  It can also be inaccurate!  Sentence-level noise is mitigated two ways: (1) sentiment is averaged across all sentences in the comment; (2) we assess sentiment across hundreds of comments.

It is possible scoring comments at the phrase level would be effective.  Here we are using DistilBERT's sentence level understanding of a sequence.

Consider YouTube's video announcement.  What do you think about hiding dislike counts -- does it degrade the user experience?
