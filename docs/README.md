### YouTube Dislike Button Remains, with Number of Dislikes Hidden from Public

* On November 10, 2021, YouTube announced that video **dislike counts** will be hidden from the public.  The stated benefit is protecting creators (especially smaller ones) from dislike attacks and harassment.
* The number of dislikes is only available in Studio to content creators.
* Announcement and Comments: https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/134791097/update-to-youtube-dislike-counts?hl=en

### Let's Analyze Sentiment for Dislike Button Update!  üßê
The public provided comments on YouTube's dislike change.  Let's score comment sentiment.  This is done on a scale of -1.0  to +1.0 (most negative to most positive sentiment).  We use the distilbert language model from the easy-to-use [flair NLP library](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) to predict sentiment.

Here is the methodology.  A comment is made of sentences and sentiment is scored for each sentence.  The score is the average sentiment for all sentences (or emoticons) in the comment.  For example, if a comment has seven sentences, then the score is the average of the seven sentiments.  Below is an illustration.

### Results
There were 613 total comments scored.  The bulk of the comments are negative sentiment.  The median sentiment is -0.739.  So half the comments score below -0.739 and half score above.

The comments were posted between November 10 and November 22 in 2021.  That is 13 days.  Did sentiment move over time?

Below is the sentiment plot, from comment #1 to comment #613.  The flat regression line reveals that sentiment moved very little between the oldest and newest comments.  Note
